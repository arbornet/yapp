Syntax: cfdelete [<conf>]

Description: This command can only be run by the conference administrator,
   and is used to delete an empty conference.  If no conference name is
   specified, Yapp will prompt for one.  Yapp will then attempt to delete 
   the indicated conference.  If the conference is not empty, it will not 
   be deleted and Yapp will issue a warning.  To delete a conference with 
   items in it, you must first kill all the items.

   If a common participation file directory is used, Yapp will also delete
   members' participation files and remove the conference from members'
   .cflist files as well.
